What is Virtual Network?
It is an own representation of Private Cloud.

Adress space and Subnet are required for Virtual Network.

Public IP Adress prefix:
It will decide the number of virtual networks
Formual to calcuate the virtual connerction for prefix: 2 power 32-n 

Static IP: The IP donot change after restarting
Dynamic IP: The IP changes after restarting. 

Subnet : will help to establish connection between virtual networks. 
A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the VNet. You can divide a VNet into multiple subnets for organization and security.


NIC: (NETWORK INTERFACE) A network interface (NIC) is the interconnection between a VM and a virtual network (VNet). A VM must have
at least one NIC, but can have more than one, depending on the size of the VM you create.

Create a VIrtual Network 
create address space and subnet in Virtual Network

Create Network Security Group

Open New VM
assign Security details to the VM in Networking tab

Connect Virtual Networks using Virtual Network Peering:

You can connect virtual networks to each other with virtual network peering.
These virtual networks can be in the same region or different regions (also known as Global VNet peering). 
Once virtual networks are peered, resources in both virtual networks are able to communicate with each other,
with the same latency and bandwidth as if the resources were in the same virtual network. In this tutorial, you learn how to:

1. Create two virtual networks
2. Connect two virtual networks with a virtual network peering
3. Deploy a virtual machine (VM) into each virtual network
4. Communicate between VMs

Virtual Networks Peering:

Step 1:
Create 2 Virtual Networks
VN1                              VN2
Name MyVn1                       Name: MyVn2
In Networking tab:
Address space: 10.0.0.0/16       Address Space: 10.0.0.0/16
Subnet: 10.0.0.0/24              Subnet: 10.0.0.0/24

Step 2:
Peer Virtual Networks:
Open MyVn1--------->Peering-------------------->Add
Virtual Network: MyVn2

Step 3: 
Create 2 Virtual Machines
MyVm1                                 MyVm2
In Networking tab:
Virtual Network: MyVn1                Virtual Network: MyVn2
Subnet: Subnet1                        Subnet: Subnet2
* Allow selected ports
*RDP

Step 4:
Communication between Virtual Machines
MyVm1-------------------> connect----------------->MSTSC

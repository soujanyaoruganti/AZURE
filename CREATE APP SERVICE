APP SERVICE IS ALSO CALLED WEB SERVICE

Azure App Service enables you to build and host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your
choice without managing infrastructure. It offers auto-scaling and high availability, supports both Windows and Linux, and enables
automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo.

INFRASTRUCTURE  refers to an enterprise's entire collection of hardware, software, networks, data centers, facilities and related 
equipment used to develop, test, operate, monitor, manage and/or support information technology services.

KEY POINTS:
WHAT IS APP SERVICE PLAN?
In App Service, an app runs in an App Service plan. An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run. 
These compute resources are analogous to the server farm in conventional web hosting. One or more apps can be configured to run 
on the same computing resources (or in the same App Service plan).

When you create an App Service plan in a certain region (for example, West Europe), a set of compute resources is created for that
plan in that region. Whatever apps you put into this App Service plan run on these compute resources as defined by your App Service
plan. Each App Service plan defines:

Region (West US, East US, etc.)
Number of VM instances
Size of VM instances (Small, Medium, Large)
Pricing tier (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, Isolated)
The pricing tier of an App Service plan determines what App Service features you get and how much you pay for the plan.
There are a few categories of pricing tiers:

Shared compute: Free and Shared, the two base tiers, runs an app on the same Azure VM as other App Service apps, including apps of 
other customers. These tiers allocate CPU quotas to each app that runs on the shared resources, and the resources cannot scale out.
Dedicated compute: The Basic, Standard, Premium, and PremiumV2 tiers run apps on dedicated Azure VMs. Only apps in the same App Service
plan share the same compute resources. The higher the tier, the more VM instances are available to you for scale-out.
Isolated: This tier runs dedicated Azure VMs on dedicated Azure Virtual Networks. It provides network isolation on top of compute 
isolation to your apps. It provides the maximum scale-out capabilities.

SKU AND SIZE?
DEV/ TEST: F1, B1 (For less demanding workloads)
PRODUCTION: P1V2, P2V2, P3V2 (For most production loads)
ISOLATED: (Advanced networking and scaling)

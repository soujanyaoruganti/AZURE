APP SERVICE IS ALSO CALLED WEB SERVICE

Azure App Service enables you to build and host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your
choice without managing infrastructure. It offers auto-scaling and high availability, supports both Windows and Linux, and enables
automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo.

equipment used to develop, test, operate, monitor, manage and/or support information technology services.

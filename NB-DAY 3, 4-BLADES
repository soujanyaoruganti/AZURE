STORAGE ACCOUNT BLADES:

OVERVIEW: TO GIVES THE OUTLOOK OR DESCRIPTION OF STORAGE ACCOUNT. 
ACTIVITY LOG: ACTIVITIES PERFORMED IN STORAGE ACCOUNT ARE RECORDED
FOR MORE ACTIVITY LOG INFORMATION GOTO BLADE: NEW SUPPORT REQUEST
ACCESS CONTROL (IAM: IDENTITY ACCESS MANAGEMENT): TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO A USER. 
3 TYPES OF ACCESS AVAILABE:
OWNER - FULL ACCESS
CONTRIBUTOR - ALL ACCESS EXCEPT CONTRIBUTOR CANNOT GIVE ACCESS TO NEW USER
READER - READ ONLY ACCESS
TAG: IDENTITY OF RESOURCE
DIAGNOSE AND SOLVE PROBLEMS: IT WILL PROVIDE DOCUMENTS AND SOLUTIONS FOR SOME COMMON TROUBLESHOOTS AND PROBLEMS
DATA TRANSFER: TO TRANSFER DATA FROM LOCAL TO CLOUD DATA TRANSFER IS USED. AND ALSO USER CAN SETUP DATA SIZE, 
NETWORK BANDWIDTH AND TRANSFER FREQUENCY.
EVENTS: TO CREATE AN EVENT TO SEND NOTIFICATIONS TO THE USER
ACCESS KEYS: When we create a storage account, Azure generates and assigns two 512-bit storage access keys to the account.
These keys are required for authentication when accessing the storage account. Two access keys are generated,
one is the primary access key and another is the secondary access key
GEO-REPLICATION: THE AZURE STORAGE REPLICATION COPIES DATA IN THE SECONDARY REGION. SO THAT IN CASE OF HARDWARE FAILURE OR 
NATURAL DISASTER THE DATA CAN BE RECOVERED FROM SECONDARY ENDPOINT 
CORS: CORS is an HTTP feature that enables a web application running under one domain to access resources in another domain. 
Web browsers implement a security restriction known as same-origin policy that prevents a web page from calling 
APIs in a different domain. CORS provides a secure way to allow one domain (the origin domain) to call APIs in another domain.
CONFIGURATION: TO UPDATE CONFIGURATIONS LIKE ACCESS TIERS, REPLICATION CAN BE MODIFIED. BUT ACCOUNT TYPE AND ACCOUNT KIND 
CANNOT BE CHANGED. 
ENCRYPTION: Storage service encryption protects your data at rest. Azure Storage encrypts your data as it's written in our datacenters, 
and automatically decrypts it for you as you access it.
By default, data in the storage account is encrypted using Microsoft Managed Keys. 
You may choose to bring your own key for encryption for Blobs and Files. You may choose to bring your own key for encryption for
Azure Blobs and Files. Encryption for Tables and Queues will always use Microsoft Managed Keys.
OR OWN KEY CAN BE CREATED WHICH IS KEY VAULT
WHAT IS KEY VAULT: 
Secrets Management– in a secure manner, one can store and control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets.
Key Management– As a key management solution, Azure Key Vault simplifies the process of creating and managing encryption keys.
Certificate Management– It serves as a service to provision, manages, and deploy public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer
Security (SSL/TLS) certificates. These can be used with Azure and other internal connected resources.
Hardware Security Modules – Secrets and keys can be protected by software, or FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs.
SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE: 
A shared access signature (SAS) is a URI that grants restricted access rights to Azure Storage resources. You can provide a 
shared access signature to clients who should not be trusted with your storage account key but whom you wish to delegate access to 
certain storage account resources. By distributing a shared access signature URI to these clients, you grant them access to a
resource for a specified period of time.
USER CAN RESTRICT 
ALLOWED SERVICES FOR: BLOB, FILE, QUEUE, TABLE
ALLOWED RESOURCE TYPES: SERVICE, CONTAINER, OBJECT
ALLOWED PERMISSION: READ, WRITE, DELETE, LIST, ADD, CREATE, UPDATE, PROCESS
START DATE AND END DATE
ALLOWED IP ADDRESS
ALLOWED PROTOCOLS: HTTPS ONLY OR HTTP AND HTTPS
FIREWALLS AND VIRTUAL NETWORKS: IT WILL ALLOW ACCESS TO ALL NETWORKS OR SELECTED NETWORKS
ADVANCED SECURITY:
STATIC WEBSITE: Enabling static websites on the blob service allows you to host static content. 
Webpages may include static content and client-side scripts. Server-side scripting is not supported.
CUSTOM DOMAIN:
SOFT DELETE: TO RECOVER DATA UPTO 365 DAYS. IF DATA DELETED FROM STORAGE ACCOUNT DATA CANNOT BE RECOVERED. 
When turned on, soft delete enables you to save and recover your blob data in many cases where blobs or blob snapshots are deleted.
AZURE CDN (CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK) : IS A TEMPORARY CACHE. 
The Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) is designed to send audio, video, images, and other files faster and more reliably to
customers using servers that are closest to the users. This dramatically increases speed and availability, resulting in significant
user experience improvements.
ADD AZURE SEARCH: FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE. UPDATED INFORMATION.
LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT: Lifecycle management offers a rich, rule-based policy for general purpose v2 and blob storage accounts. 
Use the policy to transition your data to the appropriate access tiers or expire at the end of the data's lifecycle.
FILE SHARES: TO SHARE FILES FROM OFF SHORE TO CLOUD
TABLES:TO STORE UNSTRUCTURED JASON QUERIES DATA
QUERY: TO STORE LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA
ALERTS (CLASSIC): TO NOTIFY THE CHANGES IN STORAGE ACCOUNT. CREATE MANAGE ACTION ROLE
METRICS (CLASSIC): IS BASED ON AVERAGE.
